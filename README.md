I created an application that create a front end experience which allows a user to create a task, add it to a list, update status and delete task items.

Once user input is submitted using a submit button, the app collects the information, stores it to a database. Information is displayed on the webpage including task name and task status.

3. Click the 'Add Task' button to add your "task to-do" item to your to-do list!
4. Add Tasks! Click the 'Change Task Status' button, to update your tasks.
