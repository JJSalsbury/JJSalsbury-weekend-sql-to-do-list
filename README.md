# Project Name
Weekend SQL To DO List

## Description
_Duration: Weekend Homework Assignment (Thurs-Fri)_

I created an application that create a front end experience which allows a user to create a task, add it to a list, update status and delete task items.

Once user input is submitted using a submit button, the app collects the information, stores it to a database. Information is displayed on the webpage including task name and task status.

### Prerequisites

- [Jquery.js](https://jquery.com/)
- [[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/)

## Usage
1. Create A To-Do List! Enter your "task to-do" item in the input field.
3. Click the 'Add Task' button to add your "task to-do" item to your to-do list!
4. Add Tasks! Click the 'Change Task Status' button, to update your tasks.

NOTE:
Tasks completed will appear in GREEN.
Tasks still in-progress will appear in RED.
You may delete a task, at anytime, by clicking the 'Delete' button!
